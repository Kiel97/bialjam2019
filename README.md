# Shades and Cape - My BialJam2019 entry
This is my entry for Bialjam 2019 which took place during 7-9 June 2019 in Bialystok, Poland.
Simple 2D platformer with B&W graphics, simple sounds and "easy to play, hard to master" gameplay.

Made with Godot, Piskel, GIMP and Jfxr.

Theme: Czas bohatera (Time of Hero)
